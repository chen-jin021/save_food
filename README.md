World hunger is on the rise, affecting 9.9 percent of people globally. In fact, from 2020 to 2021, the number of people who did not have access to food grew by as many as 161 million.

According to recent studies, half a pound of food is wasted per meal in restaurants, and since several restaurants overproduce, they have to throw out all the excess food at the end of the day. This method leads even an average restaurant to throw out about 100,000 pounds of trash each year, and 60% of this trash is in the form of excess food.

What if this excess food was provided to charities and people in need instead of being thrown out?

## What it does

This is exactly what Foodcerve does. Foodcerve connects local restaurants to individuals and charities in the area. Using Foodcerve, restaurants can "serve" the excess food that they have at the end of the day to people who need it. The platform streamlines this process by creating a direct connection between restaurants and consumers. A restaurant can post the food they have left and need to throw away with a location, and then a person or organization that needs it can submit a request.

## How we built it

Foodcerve was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, LocalStorage API, and TensorFlow JS.

## What's next for Foodcerve

In the future, Foodcerve will strengthen its user profile, incorporate the GoogleMaps API to help restaurants and people visualize the location better. We also hope to increase the effectiveness of the AI scanning module.
